        <ol class="animallist clearfix">
            <li><span class="first-letter">H</span>amsters. Hamsters may seem like cute, cuddly, and innocuous pets – 
                but when you learn the truth about them, 
                you’re going to wish Floofy came with a full refund. 
                These slow boats to Hell are the not so silent killers actually, as your death 
                will be a drawn out, painful series of sleepless nights due to their incessant 
                spinning on their stupid little wheels. 
                Not many prospective hamster owners know that hamsters are 
                nocturnal creatures, and are ill-prepared for the harsh reality that is 
                the sounds of little hamster feet relentlessly running on a stationary wheel, 
                night after night. In order to avoid this, keep your hamster in the garage or simply 
                avoid them all together!</li>
            <li>Baby hedgehogs. Did you know that baby hedgehogs are responsible for nearly 700 fatal heart attacks annually? 
                They are so damn cute they can stop hearts. Be aware, and stay vigilant.</li> 
            <li><span class="first-letter">G</span>oats. While goats have gone viral over the past few years due to their instinctive antics, 
                not many people know that one of their more deadly instincts is their desire to be 
                higher than others – hence their climbing of stairs, rocks, and other tall objects. 
                Many people are dealt a slow demise by goats’ killer instinct to infiltrate their workplaces 
                and manipulate their way from middle management to King Boss Overlord in two shakes of sheep’s tail. 
                Once in these positions, the goats wage psychological warfare as hegemonic rulers, 
                and starve their employees of the purpose in life that kept their hearts beating and their 
                psyches intact. </li>
            <li>Daschsunds. Basically the same as the baby hedgehogs, 
                but often only dangerous in situations of close proximity.</li>
