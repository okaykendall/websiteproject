<h3 class="finalpoem">Having A Coke With You</h3>
<p class="finalpoem" style="text-align:right">Frank O'Hara</p>
<div class="finalpoem">
  is even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Ir√∫n, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne<br>
  or being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona<br>
  partly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St. Sebastian<br>
  partly because of my love for you, partly because of your love for yoghurt<br>
  partly because of the fluorescent orange tulips around the birches<br>
  partly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuary<br>
  it is hard to believe when I'm with you that there can be anything as still<br>
  as solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of it<br>
  in the warm New York 4 o'clock light we are drifting back and forth<br>
  between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles<hr>
  
  and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paint<br>
  you suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did them<hr>
  
  I look<br>
  at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world<br>
  except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it's in the Frick<br>
  which thank heavens you haven't gone to yet so we can go together the first time<br>
  and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism<br>
  just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or<br>
  at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me<br>
  and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them<br>
  when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank<br>
  or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn't pick the rider as carefully<br>
  as the horse<hr>
  
  it seems they were all cheated of some marvelous experience<br>
  which is not going to go wasted on me which is why I am telling you about it<br>
